# Fronthaul Design for Wireless Networks: a Software Tool
This is the location of a software tool (based on the MATLAB programming language) to evaluate and compare the performance of Microwave Radio Transmission (MRT), Free Space Optics (FSO) and Fiber Optics (FO) technologies when applied to the fronthaul.
More specifically, the software tool has the following purposes:
(i) to determine the most cost-effective solution to connect two points regarding a link between a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Baseband Unit (BBU), under user-specified equipment characteristics and link conditions;
(ii) to optimally find a fronthaul topology for wireless networks, given the RRHs location â€” namely, the required number of BBUs and where they should be positioned in order to minimize the overall network costs.

The algorithms associated with these goals, designated as (i) Link Design Algorithm and (ii) Network Planning Algorithm, can be found in the files 'link_design_algorithm.m' and 'network_planning_algorithm.m', respectively, within the 'Software' folder.
